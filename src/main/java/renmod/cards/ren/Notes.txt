SKILLS
0 cost, Apply vulnerable to everyone, exhaust
Pick 1 to 2 cards from your discard and add them to your hand
Exhaust a card. Gain mana equal to its cost
5 mana attack. Deal damage equal to all carbon regenerated
Exhaust a card, gain carbon
Gain a flat amount of carbon
Consume at least 5 carbon, scry for every carbon consumed

ATTACKS
HIS CARD HAS IMAGE IMPORTED ALREADY
Maybe too hard, but a card like ritual dagger that starts at like 20% scaling and increases the scaling every time it kills an enemy (EternalDagger)
Flat damage attacks that mix with debuff like weak, vulnerable, taking damage, etc

AOE Attacks
Cards that exhaust other cards

Maybe make scraps a starter card to remove confusion about cards that scale but dont consume?
built in call to applyPowers. Call it on all cards in your hand whenever carbon changes

Respite is too weak
Make cost at the top right. Swap words. Make consume at the end
Domain expansion buff
maybe round up lmao
add block cards lmao
terror make rare
Scraps needs to have similar percentage per energy cost
remove quote from scry card
